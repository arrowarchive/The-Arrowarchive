    <h1>Oh Hello There!</h1>
    
    <p>If you're reading this page, then you've stumbled into a work-in-progress page that isn't available to the public yet. You're pretty cheeky for doing a deep dive on my website, but since you're here, I might as well explain what my goal is for this page.</p> 
    
    <p>I've seen several people, from artists to game developers and from coders to web designers, run a blog on the side where they provide updates on their current projects. These could be WIP sketches from artists, patch notes from game developers, and so on. I was originally planning on hosting a blog separately from my website, using <i>Tumblr,</i> <i>Wordpress,</i> or <i>CoHost</i> instead. Those plans fell to the wayside with <i>Tumblr</i> and <i>Wordpress</i> incorporating AI, and although <i>CoHost</i> is free from AI at the time of writing this, I'm not sure if it would work for a long-term blog because I saw several posts concerning the platform's future the last time I logged in and although it appears to be better now, it lacks the customization I would want in a development blogs. It's a good platform for artists, 3D modelers, and programmers, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
    
    <p>With that, I figured "if I want to do this right, I have to do it myself," so I added the creation of a side blog to my website's to-do list. I have ideas for the blog's interface and ease of access, but I haven't sketched them out yet. Even then, I have a feeling it's a project that will require a lot of trial-and-error before I'm content with it. I'm starting to plan out long-term goals for my website, and this is one of them, so I want it to be organized, stable, and functional. The <i>last</i> thing I want is for this website, which I hold very dear to me, to feel robotic in the same way that certain social media accounts and streaming services do. If that annoys you, then trust me, it annoys me too. This website is 100% human made, and I intend to keep it that way. I believe it's possible to make a website that serves a purpose, does it well, and feels like the people who run it genuinely care about what they do rather than focusing on the dollar signs.</p>
    
    <p>I've rambled enough to explain what this page is all about, so you should probably get going. I'm not going to explain my entire website's to-do list, that's classified information. If you want to go back to my website, there's always the back arrow on your browser, but I'll provide a redirect link to my latest works below that will take you to my latest works page.</p>
