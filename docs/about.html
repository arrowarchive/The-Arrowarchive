    <p>Hello and welcome to the Arrowarchive! My name's Rachel, and I'm the creator of this website. I am a digital artist, character designer, web developer, and web designer, having graduated college with a degree in multimedia and minors in media production and data visualization in 2024.</p>
    
    <p>Web design was not my intended career path; Originally, I prioritized animation over programming, but my perspective changed as I advanced my studies. I found myself enamored with the possibilities of web design, of building an art portfolio from the ground up, of having full creative control on my projects. My digital literacy skyrocketed from using markdown and premade layouts to using HTML and CSS to design layouts of my own. I was fascinated by how endless the possibilities appeared to be, and I wanted to show what I was truly capable of when working alone.   </p>
    
    <p>Animation took a backseat as I shifted my focus solely to web design, determined to combine my lifelong passion for art with my ever-growing knowledge of programming and UI design. I aspired to stand out as an artist by making my own portfolio that was fully independent, free from the limitations of mainstream hosting platforms. The only limitations I have are the code I build my websites with and the errors I debug along the way.</p>
    
    <p>My persistence to create my own art portfolio rather than a more professional website stems from my upbringing. I've harbored creative interests for as long as I can remember, stashing away endless pages of printer paper in binders for me to draw and write with before organizing my thoughts more coherently through sketchbooks and notebooks, which culminated in endless Word documents, an array of art programs, and at least two art tablets I've drawn with. The shows, films, and games I surrounded myself with sparked my creativity, inspiring me to design characters with their own worlds and their own stories that could inspire people the same way those creators inspired me. </p>
    
    <p>I want to be more than an artist and web designer, as I aspire to relearn animation, improve my art through my writing, and transform the incoherent worlds I've created into coherent realities, but it will be a while until I reach that point. For now, thank you for reading, and I hope you will support me on my artistic journey.</p>
    
    <!--  <p> Hello everyone! My name is Rachel, and I am the owner of the Arrowarchive. I am a twenty two year old artist, writer, multimedia graduate, and aspiring showrunner. Multimedia was a big part of my life; from animated shows and films to video games, I was fascinated by the stories people told, how creative they were, the effort that went into them, and how passionate everyone was about their work. It was their passion that inspired me to create my own worlds, and it's my goal to inspire others the same way they inspired me.</p>
    
    <p> Before college, I interned with a printing company in my hometown. I helped design, pack, and print over 2,000 shirts for my school's biennial charity event. I began taking digital art seriously around this time, using <i>Inkscape</i> and <i>Adobe Illustrator</i> on my computer before getting my first art tablet and a copy of <i>Clip Studio Paint.</i> I continued using CSP after switching to an iPad in the summer of 2020, which I use to this day.</p>
    
    <p> Since starting college, I have enrolled in several digital art and coding classes. I constructed my first website out of markdown in late 2020, and I started learning HTML in early 2021. I have constructed a second website since then and this is my third. It is a reimagining of my first website, built from the ground up with a layout that matches my personality. In late 2021, I co-founded a club that specializes in film production and website development. I am currently one of the leaders for web development and my goal is to help others build digital portfolios while learning techniques I can incorporate here.</p>
    
    <p> Outside of drawing, writing, and coding, I love watching shows and playing games with friends. I am critical of the content I watch, so I may dedicate a section of my website to my favorites. I might post a list of my favorites in the future.</p> -->
