                <p>Earlier this year, there was a trend tagging on <i>Twitter</i> called #faceyourart. Having drawn a lot earlier in the year and witnessing my friends take part in the tag, I thought “Why not? I can do this too." This is my take on the challenge and what’s on the front page of my site (though that’s subject to change).</p>
                
                <p>I can’t believe all of these drawings were made this year. I don’t know where the time went, but it was time well spent!</p>
