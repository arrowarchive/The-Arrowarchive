            <h1>Ocean Desk</h1>
       <figure class="mainImage"> <img src="../../images/other/oceanDesk.png" alt="Where the mermaids write, if they can write" title="If mermaids can write, would they write on stones or seaweed? If they have paper, is it waterproof?" oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                
                <p>The ocean desk is one of my favorite items in the set so far. Itâ€™s based on my desk, which has a removable filing cabinet containing two drawers and a gap above them. I wanted the ocean influence to be more noticeable, so I added a seahorse design on the side, bubbles on the corners, a seaweed handle, a golden seaweed handle, and pearl drawer pulls.</p>
                
                <p>I have one more item that I have designed for the set, and I will finish the rest of it at a later date.</p>
