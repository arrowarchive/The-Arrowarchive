        <h1>Ocean Drawer</h1>
        <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/other/oceandrawer.png" alt="Quite a bubbly disposition" title="I'm sure whatever goes on this table is more dense than the ocean itself. It must be, otherwise it would float to ocean's surface or the ceiling above it." oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                
                <p>Another item in my ocean furniture series is a nightstand. It is royal blue like the other items, but it has light blue bubbles on the sides, a conch shell design on its surface, and drawer handles based on bettas.</p>
