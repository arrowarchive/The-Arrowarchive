                <p>Happy Easter Everyone!</p> 
                
                <p>I've had a lot of work and less time to draw, but I made an Easter drawing and I finished it early... somehow. I can't explain that. I had to wait over a week to share this, but it was better to start and finish early than wait and finish late.</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to add more to add more to this, but I felt like designing the eggs was enough. From left to right, they are based on my characters and the projects they came from; There's Kessh≈ç's egg decorated with rabbits and crystals (<i>Unfamiliar</i>), Aqua's egg with polka dots and the signature star (SPACE Warriors), and Lylatt's egg decorated with the symbols of her friends (<i>Joyride</i>).</p>
                
                <p>These eggs took a lot of effort to design, but they were worth it. I hope they work well with the pastel background/effects, and the picture appeals to the eye. I hope you have a Happy Easter if you celebrate it, and if you don't, I hope you have a great day!</p>
