                <h1>Aqua and Kesshō</h1>

                <p>Time for me to write about the former page image for my site.</p>
                <p>Back in February, I wanted to draw two of my characters, Aqua and Kesshō, together. Unfortunately, since they are in different universes and I hadn't developed their worlds, I decided to stick with something simple. I felt comfortable using a gradient and adding a lot of glitter to compensate for it.</p>
                <p>Other factors influenced this drawing as well; this website was a developing concept, I wanted this to match my profile picture, and I didn't finish Lylatt's design until four days later. Even then, <i>Joyride</i> was in its infancy and I was busy with school. My time for art was limited, and life was a balancing act. Even at the time of writing this (June 24th, 2021), it still is.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, I wanted to cement Kesshō's redesign. I commissioned Cele to draw her a while back and I was inspired by his interpretation of her. Her redesign began as a composite of his design with my original designs, but I expanded upon them here. I gave her a curly hairstyle, the crystals are more detailed and embedded into her hair, and she has a longer cape. That's what I wanted when designing her, and I'm happy she turned out this way. She turned out great, but my only gripe about this doesn't involves her: it's the fact that I forgot to add Aqua's star pin and I refused to add it in because it wouldn't look right.</p>
                <p>I didn't write an entry for this immediately after I posted it because I felt like as the page image, I didn't need to say any more about it. The day I replaced it is the day I'd write about it, and I'm glad I got to put my thoughts into words. This is one of my favorite drawings this year, and it did its job well. Now, I have a new image for the front page, and I can't wait to show it off!</p>
