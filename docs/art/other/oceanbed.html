                <p>The most recent addition to the ocean furniture set, the bed takes a subtler approach to the ocean aesthetic. Featuring a clam shell headboard, a wave-patterned comforter, and pearl-like pillows, it was a test of incorporating a motif into a design while retaining its subtlety.</p>
                
                <p>It was challenging, no doubt about it, but Iâ€™m satisfied with the result and I intend to do the same with the remaining items.</p>
