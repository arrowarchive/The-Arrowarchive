                <p>I dabbled in furniture design over the summer. I drew a layout for an ocean-themed room and several items that go with it. The oldest design in this collection is a bookshelf. Itâ€™s royal blue with gold-pink, and silver accents, decorated with sand dollars of various sizes. I like the idea behind it, so I may experiment with it more.</p>
