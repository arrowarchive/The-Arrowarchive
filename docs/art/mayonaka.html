        <h1>Mayonaka Redesign</h1>
        <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../images/unfamiliar/mayonaka.PNG" oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                <p>I've achieved a lot in only six months. I'm getting better at shading, I've designed several new characters, I put the Arrowarchive in beta, and I've drawn most of my characters at least once.</p>
                <p>Key word: <b>most</b></p>
                <p>There are a few characters I haven't drawn this year. As of June 1st, the only characters I haven't drawn this year are Mythos, Nihilus, Cadence, and Mayonaka. I'm excluding Chlora from this list because I have a doodle sheet for her that I'm working on.</p>
                <p>If it wasn't obvious, I chose Mayonaka. I like the sky rabbits, and it's been forever since I've drawn them. I didn't choose Nimbus because I've drawn her twice this year. I've drawn Mayonaka twice, and one of them was a younger version of her. Since I redesigned Nimbus, I figured Mayonaka should get one too. Not much about her has changed except for her hair and crystals, but it's enough for me to talk about.</p>
                <p>I used this piece to experiment with lighting and glow effects. The moon glows, the stars glow, Mayonaka's crystals glow, and her eyes have a shine to them. I say this without mentioning the lighting on her fur cape. It took a lot of patience, but it was worth it in my opinion.</p>
