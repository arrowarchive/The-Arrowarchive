    <h2>A new layout is planned for entries with multiple pictures. If this entry goes down at a future date or the link redirects elsewhere, that's why.</h2>

                <p>When <i>Pokemon Sword and Shield</i> was in development, I had a conversation with a friend about Scorbunny’s type. He insisted it would be another fire/fighting type, and I said it would be cool to see a fire/fairy type. He asked what that would look like, and I drew it. What was supposed to be a fire/fairy rabbit evolved into something new.</p> 
                
                <p>The first picture is the original rabbit design from 2019, and the second picture is a redesign I did this summer. Their names, from left to right are <b>Kumo</b> (雲), <b>Kesshō</b> (結晶) and <b>Kōri</b> (氷), Japanese for <b>cloud</b>, <b>crystal</b>, and <b>ice</b> respectively.</p>
                
                <p>I love their designs, and I need to draw them more. For now, enjoy this piece I made!</p>
