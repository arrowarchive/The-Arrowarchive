                <p>Before switching to my iPad, there was a null period where I didn't focus on any big projects and worked on a few smaller ones instead. Two pieces came from this period: Electra's redesign, and the concept for Nihilus.</p>
                
                <p>Nihilus is a part of a group called "the Chess Knights" and I planned to draw all of them in the same picture, but she was the only one I finished before I got my iPad. I gave up on drawing them together and saved her design for later. This came in handy on Halloween, since I had the basics of her personality written and I tweaked her concept to fit the occasion. I'll explain more on that post.</p>
                
                <p>I have a few more notes about her design. Her hat and scarf are parts of her and will act or react based on her behavior. This was inspired by a show I watched growing up called <i>Hero: 108</i>, where one character had a companion with her named "Yaksha" that looked like a hat and scarf combined. It was a very obscure show, but one that inspired me nonetheless. Her clothes don't show any emotion here because I was hesitant to go through with the idea. I decided to use it in the Halloween piece, which captured the more intense side of her personality. My drawing of her in 2021 captures her sweeter side.</p>
                
                <p>Her design and personality are complex, but the magical aspect of her character makes it worth the effort.</p>
