        <h1>Introducing: Jade</h1>
        <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/space/jadeConcept.png" oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                <p><b>These were previously undated drawings I posted on <i>Instagram</i> in 2020.</b> I have found when I posted them, so I am archiving them here. As a result, these are my present thoughts on the drawings.</p>
                <p>I remember Jade being one of the first supporting characters I designed. Every character I designed before her has a major role, but I didn't think much about extras until I started doing character development exercises for a class, which made me think about it more.</p>
                <p>She's Chlora's superior, but they are extremely close. I wanted her haircut to be a sign of rebelliousness in an otherwise strict work environment. It still works, in my opinion, but I feel like if I drew her again, I could draw her hair better.</p>
                <p>I have some notes about her design: The stripes under her blouse are based on a sarashi, as I intend for her to wield a weapon such as a hammer, which has recoil and risks harming its user. Her uniform is different than Chlora's, having no tie or blazer but a longer skirt, to have her stand out among others in her department. Lastly, her color palette was inspired by the jades that appeared in <i>Steven Universe</i></p>
                <p>If I have anything else to say, it's that she was supposed to be in a design sheet with Bumble and Ember, but it never came to be. I drew two of them on their own and forgot about Jade. I hope to draw her again in the future.</p>
