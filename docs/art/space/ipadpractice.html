                <p>I got an iPad in June of 2020, and I couldn’t wait to draw with it! I ordered some screen protectors, downloaded <i>Clip Studio</i>, and after a few days, I hit the ground running! my first drawings were of Aqua, Electra, Shadow, and Chlora, characters who I was the most confident drawing at the time.</p>
                
                <p>Looking back, My style has changed significantly; my lines were thicker and Chlora’s hair is different, but these were quick drawings (by my standards, anyway.) This was a good test run for my iPad and its version of <i>Clip Studio</i>, and I was ready to switch after using the PC version two years prior.</p>
