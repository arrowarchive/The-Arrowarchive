<h1>Introducing: Bumble</h1>

                <p>I made a new thumbnail since I made this image, but I'm not sure how good it looks. I have to see it for myself.</p>
                
                <p>That aside, let me give my thoughts: a while back, I was talking with a friend of mine. He’s a fan of <i>My Hero Academia</i>, and I showed him my design for Electra. He liked how it looked, but he thought it would be nice to make an homage to the series by adding a black lightning bolt to his hair like Kaminari does.</p>
                
                <p>I liked the idea, but I didn’t want to use it for him; Electra’s hair color is almost identical to Kaminari’s, so I held onto the idea and used it for another character. Bumble’s hair color is the opposite of Electra’s, so the homage is more subtle. It looks good with the stripes on her arms, but I need to remember which side of her face the lightning bolt is on.</p>
