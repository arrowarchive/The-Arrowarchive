    <p>If you saw this and thought “I’ve seen this before”, then you’re right. This was originally two separate pictures, one for the girls and one for the guys, but I decided to combine the two. They are arranged by name, as that’s what “SPACE Warriors” is an acronym of.</p>
    
    <p>This was done for convenience, but also for scale; Pyro is the tallest (5’10"/178 cm) and Chlora is the shortest (5’2"/157 cm, but stands at 5’4"/163 cm with heels on), so when I lined them up together, I wanted to convey that.</p>
    
    <p>It’s not 100% accurate, but it’s close enough. They look good, the gradient looks good, and I’m glad to have a piece, even if it isn’t new where, they’re all together.</p>
