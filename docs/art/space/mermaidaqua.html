                <p>I love the mermaid set in <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i>, so when I learned that the developers added clothes to the series, I was ecstatic! After obtaining a few of the items, I looked up what the rest of them looked like, and to my surprise, there was a pink palette!</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to draw one of my characters wearing the outfits, but I couldn’t decide on the colors. Ultimately, due to Aqua’s palette, I made her wear the pink clothes. This was fun to work on, and I don’t draw my characters wearing fun outfits as much as I should. Maybe I should fix that.</p>
