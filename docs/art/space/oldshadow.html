        <h1>Old Shadow</h1>
        <img src="../../images/space/lost3.png" width="575" oncontextmenu="return false;"/>
                <p><b>These were previously undated drawings I posted on <i>Instagram</i> in 2020.</b> I have found when I posted them, so I am archiving them here. As a result, these are my present thoughts on the drawings.</p>
                <p>Shadow looks so similar, but so different. I guess that's what happens when you look at your old work.</p>
                <p>Drawing on my laptop was how I spent my study halls. It has a reversible screen so it can be used like a tablet and I had a working pen. I finalized Shadow's outfit at the end of 2019 so I knew how she would look when I drew her again, and that I did.</p>
                <p>Ideas from her current design can be traced back to this. Her worn-out cold-sholder top with grey boots and ripped jeans came from here, but this is her main palette. I have two different palettes I designed for her clothes that didn't make the cut. I have a screenshot of her from February 2020, so it's a lost treasure I'll add later.</p>
                <p>I designed Shadow's hatchets in December 2019, and I designed Aqua's swords around the same time. I didn't know how to shade, so I tried to eyeball it. I drew the axes at a larger scale and shrank them down to fit in her hands. The perspective for them, along with her jeans, were the most difficult parts of the piece.</p>
                <p>I'll describe her design changes from then to now in one word: serendipity. With that many rips and tears, adjusting them to fit different poses gets tiresome. Just compare this to my later drawings, it's clear when her evolution starts.</p>
