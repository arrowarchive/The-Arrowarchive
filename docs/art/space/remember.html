                <p>I've been drawing my characters more, but I've been writing their stories as well. Each character's story is unique, but Shadow's story is one of the most tragic.</p>
                <p>I'm still writing her story, but she witnessed a lot of horrible events that brought out the worst in people, had to change her personality to prove herself, and conditioned herself to see genuine emotion as a weakness... Not exactly sunshine and rainbows, is it?</p>
                <p>This is the most serious piece I've done, and it shows. I wanted to capture anger, fear, and insecurity all in one place, and I think I succeeded. I showed how afraid her past self was, her anger in the present, and her insecurities through the text. I think the red gradient highlights this, as it makes the tone more intense.</p>
                <p>Design methods aside, I want to discuss the piece as a whole. I designed a set of armor for Shadow last year but it's very different compared to this one. It was made of leather and lacked the glowing gemstones this design has.</p>
                <p>This was my first time drawing young Shadow as well. I had four ideas for her; give her shorter hair/bangs, show her shirt intact, explain why she's missing her star, and try to incorporate the color white somehow. I met all the criteria, and I'm satisfied with how she turned out. I plan to keep using that design for when she has to flash back to a past event.</p>
                <p>One last note: you're probably seeing this and thinking "Only one drawing for July?!" well, I've been busy this month, and this isn't the <i>only</i> drawing I made in July. If you follow me on <i>Twitter,</i> I mentioned finishing a big project a while back. It wasn't this piece, but there's a reason I haven't shared it yet. I'll post it there soon, but it's not something I'll share here. I also did some fan art for <i>Don't Starve,</i> but I'm not posting it here. This portfolio is for original art, so any fan art I draw stays on my <i>Twitter</i> account.</p>
