    <h1>Updated Wave Breaker (Featuring Shadow's Hatchets)</h1>

    <p>In my timed drawing of Aqua from the <i>Inkscape</i> era, I mention that it was the first time I've drawn Aqua's sword, The Wave Breaker. I went on to mention that I redesigned the sword in December, and I found the sketch for her redesigned sword. I finished the redesign on the same day that I finished designing Shadow's hatchets, so I decided to feature both of them here. </p>
    
    <p>By December 2019, I was using <i>Clip Studio Paint</i> on my second laptop. I had two or three study halls a week due to my schedule at the time, so when I wasn't doing homework, studying, or reading for a class, I was sketching on my laptop and finding my niche with <i>Clip Studio.</i> The program had a learning curve, especially with how bare-bones official tutorials were and how scarce third-party tutorials were, so was learning on my own through trial-and-error. It was frustrating when I struggled to get things right, but after enough practice and research, I found a rhythm that worked for me.</p>
    
    <p>I always intended for Shadow to wield hatchets, but all I had to go off of were rough sketches in the notebooks and sketchbooks I carried around. This was my first time drawing them digitally AND in color, so I wanted them to look their best. I wanted her hatchets to appear as if they were salvaged and restored; giving them a new coat of paint, adding metal coils by the grips, and topping them off with gemstones to make them look good as new. Both hatchets look identical, so I only had to draw one of them in order for the idea to stick. Her hatchets debuted with her official color palette in March of 2020.</p>
    
    <p>The Wave Breaker is different from Shadow's hatchets because I wanted the sword to be custom-made for Aqua. She received it as a gift from someone close to her, and it's tailored specifically to her fighting style. The design for it is based on Rose's sword from <i>Steven Universe,</i> with it having a similar hilt but a different blade shape and a pattern unique to her. Unlike Shadow's hatchets, it took until next September for the redesigned Wave Breaker to debut, as I didn't know how to make Aqua look intimidating with it or draw her using it mid-fight at the time. Both weapons received touch-ups the next time they were drawn and may need additional touch-ups when drawn in the future, but I'm happy with how they look and I hope that these weapon designs will stick for the modern incarnations of the characters they were made for.</p>
