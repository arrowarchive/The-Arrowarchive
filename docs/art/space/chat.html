        <h1>Casual Discussion</h1>
        <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/space/chat.PNG" oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                <p>What started as a drawing between studies became an experiment with perspective, shading, and clothing design. Do I regret it? Not at all! I've had trouble designing the living spaces for my characters, so I decided to start small. I used assets provided by <i>Clip Studio</i> to stage the scene, adjusted the poses, and experimented with the perspective to provide the look I wanted. It took a while to get it right, but I'm happy with the result.</p>
                <p>This drawing is the beginning of my experiments with room design, perspective, and putting my characters in more varied environments rather than gradient backgrounds with a lot of effects. Those drawings are fun, but I want to expand my horizons.</p>
                <p>The room is plain for what it is and the characters are wearing casual clothes, but that is what the piece is supposed to be: casual. I didn't want to fret over the folds on Aqua's dress or how the emblem on Pyro's shirt would look post-shading. I feel like this may be redrawn once I have more experience, but I like how it looks.<br /> 
                    
                    <br /><b>Side note:</b> I haven't drawn Pyro since August, and his design barely changed. I guess I'm satisfied with his design right now. No, the compilation picture in December doesn't count.</p>
                <p>(If anyone finds the <i>Dream Team</i> easter eggs in this picture, you have my respect)</p>
