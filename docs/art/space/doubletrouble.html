                <p>I get so caught up in creating characters and drawing my favorites in new scenarios that I sometimes forget about others I’ve made. My brain reminded me that I haven’t drawn Electra in a while, then that I haven’t drawn Bumble in a while, so I drew them together. Problem solved, right?</p>
                
                <p>...Well, yes and no. I have a lot of characters I haven’t drawn in a while, and while I want to draw them, but I haven’t had enough time and ideas for it. They are on the backburner, so I’ll get there at one some point.</p>
                
                <p>For now, enjoy these two stinkers! Bumble got a redesign and a new haircut, and I think she pulls them off well. Electra’s lab coat was tweaked but his design is unchanged otherwise. I want to bring back some other familiar faces, but I don’t know who. Until then, I’ll let you guess who I’m thinking of.</p>
