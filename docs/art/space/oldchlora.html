        <h1>Old Chlora</h1>
        <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/space/oldChlora.png" oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                <p><b>These were previously undated drawings I posted on <i>Instagram</i> in 2020.</b> I have found when I posted them, so I am archiving them here. As a result, these are my present thoughts on the drawings.</p>
                <p>This is not the oldest version of Chlora I have, but it <i>is</i> the oldest drawing of her that I can put a date to. I remember changing her appearance from a green leotard and grass skirt to a business style; high heels, glasses, a blazer, and putting her hair in a bun. I call this look "The bun phase," and I don't need to say anymore about that.</p>
                <p>I don't feel like I started getting proportions right until late 2020/early 2021. I was eyeballing them, and looking at them now, they look off. To distinguish her from Aqua and Shadow, I gave her a "noodle" physique, which has carried over in redesigns, but for this drawing, it wasn't the best idea.</p>
                <p>The drawing itself looks okay, but this was the first time I drew her with this outfit. Her arms cover most of her blazer, blouse, and tie. I remember taking screenshots before adding color so I could get her outfit right in future drawings. I don't like how short the skirt is either. In my recent drawings for her, I gave her a brown skirt and I'm experimenting with its length.</p>
                <p>If it wasn't obvious, I'm pretty critical of this one. I don't hate it, but I look back at it and think "how did 2020 me think this was okay?" I guess it's a sign of my art confidence at the time, my confidence now, and how I've improved art-wise since then. </p>
