                <p>Pyro and Electra’s picture inspired me to draw another piece, but with the girls instead. I feel like more planning went into this one, especially with the character layout; blue goes well with both green and purple, so it was natural for me to put Aqua in the middle. The poses? I wanted to convey their personalities through body language. Their weapons? I designed them, but I was out of practice with drawing them. I’m proud of how they look, and I’ll continue using these designs!</p>
                
                <p>Out of everyone, Chlora’s design took the most effort. I tried something new with her hair, I added the star to her tie, and while I designed her whip, I didn’t have a colored sketch for it. That, and I had to mirror her pose because there aren’t a lot of left-handed poses online and there needs to be more!!! I tried something new with the shading as well, which I really enjoy because I look back and it still looks great!</p>
                
                <p>Rambling aside, I love this piece so much. I drew it in September, but it feels like I drew it recently. I can’t wait to draw these three again, and I can’t wait to draw them together!</p>
