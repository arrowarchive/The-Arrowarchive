            <h1>I Can't Fix You (Redraw)</h1>

                <p>I listen to music when I draw, and one song “I Can’t Fix You” by <i>The Living Tombstone</i>, caught my attention. There was one scene where four characters were shown in silhouette, which inspired me to draw it with five of my characters. Since I posted this, I have introduced all the characters, so I'll provide my current thoughts on the piece as of 2021.</p>
                
                <p>All of this was done in a day, with Bumble and Ember receiving that honor later. I rarely finish a drawing in a day unless I'm highly motivated or the piece has minimal detail. This is an example of the latter, with the background taking the most time. If I drew this a year later, I would make the eyes glow and shade the characters better. Chlora's hair would be different too, since she had a different cut when I drew her in September and refined it the following June. The biggest changes I'd make, excluding what I just mentioned, would be adding more effects and blending the background more.</p>
                <p>My final note about this piece is that this is one of the last drawings I did on my computer before getting an iPad. There were two others that followed it, but I completed my first iPad drawing less than a month later. It's crazy for me to think about that.</p>
                <p>You can listen to the song that inspired the piece <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXMwZNRiPe0"><b>here</b></a></p>
                
                <p>If you want to see the video, I’ll warn you: <b>the video contains flashing lights and images, which may not be suitable for photosensitive viewers.</b> There are other videos featuring the song without the animation, but viewer discretion is advised (I’m stating this because it’s listed in the video’s description, but I don’t know who pays attention to video descriptions nowadays.)</p>
