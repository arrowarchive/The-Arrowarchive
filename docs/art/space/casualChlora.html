    <h1>Chlora's New Do</h1>

    <p>This piece was an unexpected find! I was checking my files to see if there were any other <i>Space</i> drawings I could upload to my website, and I found this! The dates were accurate and I remember drawing this, but I was surprised to learn that I never posted this on any of my social media outlets! I was still using <i>Instagram</i> at the time, I didn't join <i>Twitter</i> yet, and I never considered posting it after joining <i>Twitter</i> in mid-July. Maybe I thought it was too old of a piece to post on a new social media platform, but if that was my logic, why did I repost several pieces I considered "lost art" and not include this in the bunch?</p>
    
    <p>This was the second piece to feature Chlora with a new hairstyle after my piece from the <i>Pinterest</i> study a few days prior. I wanted to see how she'd look without the glasses, in a casual outfit that I felt like she could pull off, and gave her a short bob cut. I used a pose reference from <i>Pinterest,</i> but I had trouble drawing her hands and feet. On a brighter note, I'm happy with her outfit, the color palette I chose for her clothes, and how I drew her walking, even if the feet tripped me up a bit.</p>
    
    <p>This drawing is notable for being the first time I've drawn Chlora outside of her business outfit, and also for being the second time I've drawn her with her modern palette (her <i>Pinterest</i> study was first). I liked Chlora's hairstyle enough to use it in my drawing inspired by <i>The Living Tombstone</i> about a week later, only for me to try a slightly longer hairstyle the next month and stick with it the next time I drew her in September. </p>
    
    <p>This was an experimental drawing, for sure, but it was influential to the evolution of Chlora's design. I can see myself giving Chlora an outfit similar to this when spending time with the group, but I'd have to make the distinction between this outfit and "the neopolitan outfit" I gave her in 2021. Even when my characters change, I take note of previous details and see if I can reuse them at a later date. Ideas left on the cutting room floor can always be reused if you care enough about them.</p>
