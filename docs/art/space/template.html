    <h1>Gallery Redirect</h1>
    
    <p>This page is a placeholder for my gallery redirects until their layouts or entries are finished.</p> 
    
    <p>Several blogs on the archive include more than one image, and I have mapped out a layout design for users to scroll through them using arrows rather than scroll down to view all the pictures. This will take some time to design, so if gallery links redirect here, it is because their layout is in development until further notice or because their entries are incomplete. </p>
    
    <p>I apologize for the inconvenience, but that's the way it is when you're coding your portfolio from scratch. Thank you for understanding!</p>
