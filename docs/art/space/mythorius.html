                <p>I’ve wanted to draw a fusion character for a long time, but I shelved the idea when I redesigned one of their components. I decided to give the design another shot when I found a sketchbook from two years ago containing their design. After a little thought, I gave their design another shot, and I’m really proud of it!</p>
                
                <p>Their dress is inspired by Pyrope’s from <i>Steven Universe: Unleash the Light</i>, whose skirt shows off her legs. The hair, on the other hand, was all my idea. I thought Shadow’s hair was the craziest hair I’ve drawn so far, but this is a whole new level. Crazy hair is fun to draw, what can I say?</p>
