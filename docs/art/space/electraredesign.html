        <h1>Electra's Redesign</h1>
        <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/space/electraredesign.png" oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
                
                <p>Electra’s redesign was in development around the same time as Pyro’s, but unlike him, Electra had a full-body sketch of his redesign before I made it official. This is the first shaded drawing of his new design.</p>
                
                <p>Electra’s redesign has a steampunk influence, borrowing some elements from the <i>Danganronpa</i> series. He has a ripped jacket like Komaeda, fingerless gloves like Iruma, and dangling belts like Ouma. His glasses and boots are entirely new, and fit the steampunk aesthetic.</p>
                
                <p>Calling him a modern steampunk is an understatement, and the steampunk style as a whole is underrated. I’m satisfied with how he looks, but I need to draw him like this again. It’s been too long since I’ve last drawn him.</p>
