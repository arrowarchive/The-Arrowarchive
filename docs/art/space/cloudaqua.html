                <p>On May 28th, I tweeted that I wanted to draw Aqua in a dress that made her look "like a pimped-out Mega Altaria." Fast-forward to today, and look what we have here.</p>
                <p>This was on my to-do list before I tweeted about it. I like associating Aqua with the ocean, but it's too predictable for her in my opinion. Clouds make more sense because of how unpredictable their weather patterns are, not to mention her being on cloud nine.</p>
                <p>This is one of the prettiest pieces I've made this year, as the colors go together really well and I found a good brush for clouds. I've been painting the lines more as well, but I'm hesitant to paint the skin to match the shading. It's time-consuming and precise, so I still need to figure it out. Maybe I'll get to that point one day, but for now, I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.</p>
