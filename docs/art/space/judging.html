                <p>This was a work-in-progress I've been sitting on for a while. Was it because I started it during finals week? Was it because I wasn't used to drawing furniture? Was it because I had trouble with the perspective? </p>
                
                <p>No. Actually, it was none of those reasons. It was because I couldn't draw her hair.</p>
                <p>Shadow is one of my favorite characters to draw, but she's also one of the most difficult. Unlike Aqua, who has symmetrical waist-length hair, Shadow's hair is asymmetrical and reaches her knees. It <i>does</i> cover part of her face so I only have to draw one eye, but other aspects of her design make each drawing a challenge.</p>
                <p>I'm not used to drawing furniture, so her hair made it more complicated. It took a while for me to figure out how to draw her without her hair completely obscuring the chair, but it took even longer for me to shade it so I could give the illusion that she was sitting on it.</p>
                <p>There are other things I wanted to add here, such as ax marks in the walls and a basic wallpaper, but I was afraid that it would distract from the focal point of the image. I decided to add a rug, blur the wallpaper, and add one of my old drawings as a picture frame instead.</p>
                <p>This is my second experiment with perspective, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. If I can create believable environments for my characters without having the backgrounds look off, then it will be worth the effort I put into it!</p>
