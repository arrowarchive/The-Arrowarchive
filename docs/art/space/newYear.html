                <h1>Happy New Year! (2021)</h1>
            <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/space/newYear21.PNG"

                <p>After the chaos that was 2020, I was ready to kick off 2021 on a high note. Sketching this on New Year’s Eve and finishing it on New Year’s Day, I’ve decided to make Aqua and Kesshō the mascots of my portfolio.</p> 
                
                <p>I redesigned Kesshō just before drawing this and I’m happy with how she looks (especially since I gave her a more detailed look on the front page). My only other note with the piece is that I’m surprised <i>Clip Studio</i> doesn’t have any confetti brushes. I had to find one myself, but I’m really happy with how it looks!</p>
                
                <p>I know I didn’t post an entry for this when it premiered because I wanted to wait until the New Year passed to write about it. I hope you enjoy my thoughts on this!</p>
