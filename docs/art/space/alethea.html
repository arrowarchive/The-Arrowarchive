    <p>Another character black, white, and grey character design for February… Is this a pattern? probably not.</p> 
    
    <p>I had this design in mind for a while; I figured out everything except for her look. After experimenting with Clip Studio’s 3D models and browsing “Create-a-Sim” in <i>The Sims 4</i>, I started working on her design. I did this all in one day (much like Ember), and I’m proud of the result. Pink Pearl from <i>Steven Universe</i>  influenced her design as well, but that is a minor detail.</p>
    
    <p>On a side note, I’m going experiment with CSP’s 3D models more. I got the pose right and I’m happy with her hands and feet (two areas I struggle with), but I feel like her arms and legs are too long. The models have realistic proportions, so I may adjust them slightly to fit my style better. That, and I’m going to find a way to position the models so they won’t take up the whole page. CSP's perspective tools have a learning curve, but I am slowly making them work.</p>
