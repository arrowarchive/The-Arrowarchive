    <h1>Unamused Shadow</h1>
    <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../images/space/unamusedShadow.png" alt="She'd rather be anywhere else" title="we all know that ONE person who brings a camera or video camera on a trip, butting into moments when people are trying to have fun because they're putting together a photo album or travel tape you'll never get to see. If you ARE that person, I'd recommend asking before hitting the shutter." oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>
    <p><i>Insert clever title here</i></p>
    <p>Yeah, the title’s lame, but this was a pose study I did in July with Shadow that I found funny. I picture Aqua taking photos of everyone and Shadow is having none of it; she agreed to the photo so Aqua would leave her alone, but she didn’t promise that she would smile.</p>
    <p>If it wasn’t obvious, Shadow’s the moody one who likes to fight and mess with the others. She’s my favorite to draw because of her design, and her expressions stand out because I have one eye to work with (her other eye is covered by her hair.)</p>
    <p>I think I’ve drawn her and Aqua the most, but I can’t say for sure. Their designs have changed the most, that’s for sure.</p>
