    <p>My first drawing of the sky rabbits featured Nimbus and her evolution line,
        but after listening to “Mayday” by <i>TheFatRat</i>, I was inspired to draw
        her again.</p>
    
    <p>This time, it’s a yin and yang-like drawing featuring Nimbus and her
        counterpart, <b>Mayonaka</b> (真夜中), whose names translates to
        <b>midnight</b> in Japanese. She’s a similar species of rabbit, but with
        different powers compared to Nimbus. I like her design, so I need to draw
        her again later. </p>
    
    <p>That said, I love how the midnight/sunrise contrast on this piece turned out.
        It took a while, but I’m very proud of it!</p>
