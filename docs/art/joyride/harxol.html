                    <h1>Introducing: Harxol</h1>
            <figure class="mainImage"><img src="../../images/joyride/Harxol.png" alt="Crystal Alien" 
                oncontextmenu="return false;"/></figure>

                <p>In 2019, I challenged myself to complete a drawing with as few outlines as possible. The end result was a character with several traits that deviate from my style, yet I'm really fond of him.</p> 
                
                <p>This is Harxol, an alien character with a somewhat futuristic design. His name is derived from "heart" and "crystal", which should be obvious. I want to draw him again someday, since I have other aliens I want to design and one of them is robotic like him. It would be fun to draw them together, but I need to design the other character first.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>UPDATE:</b> I revisited this piece in November of 2022 after deciding to make this the first drawing I'd post on Tumblr. I realized how much history Harxol has in my gallery despite how little I've drawn him: I sketched him in a notebook in 2019 during my <i>Inkscape</i> era, when I was heavily reliant on images I scanned into my computer and used as a template for the line art. Harxol's original sketch was <i>not</i> scanned into my computer and I redrew him from scratch. He was the only character from that era that has stuck with me to this day, as every other character existed for at least a year before I started using the program and if there were new characters, they were scrapped before I joined social media.</p>
                    <p>Harxol's debut was prolonged, but it wasn't because I had trouble with his redesign. It was because I made him too soon. If I joined social media around the time I finished his original design, he would've made his debut then. Instead, he made his debut when I thought of redesigning him in 2021. I've only drawn Harxol once since his redesign, but it's because I haven't had any ideas for his character since then. Hopefully I will draw him more in the future.</p>
