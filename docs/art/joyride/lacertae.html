    <h1>Introducing: Lacertae</h1>

    <p> After a month of on-and-off work, the last member of the <i>Joyride</i> trio is complete. I had less time to work on their design because of school, but they are also one of the most complicated designs I have made so far.</p>
    
    <p>Lacertae's design is inspired by Gundham building kits I received a while back. They were surprisingly small, barely larger than my hand, and their pieces were very intricate. They were the main source of inspiration, but I studied Master Chief's armor from <i>Halo</i>, the robots from <i>Portal</i>, and Mecha Mewtwo from <i>Pokemon</i>, the last of which inspired the helmet, which was designed before the rest of their body.</p>
    
    <p>The <i>Joyride</i> characters, Lacertae especially, are stylistic triumphs. They deviate from my usual style, featuring traits my other characters lack. I made it my goal to make them stand out, and if I drew all of my characters together, I feel like they would be very recognizable. They should become easier to draw after enough practice.</p>
    
    <p>Final thoughts? Designing Lacertae was like building a Gundham; they took a lot of patience, were very meticulous, and my hands hurt after a while because I lacked experience, but the result was worth the effort.</p>
